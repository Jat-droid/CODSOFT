# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is part of my internship at **CodSoft** under the Data Science track.

## 📌 Task Overview
Using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, gender, class, and fare.

## 📊 Dataset
- [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- Contains features like:
  - PassengerId
  - Pclass
  - Name
  - Sex
  - Age
  - SibSp
  - Parch
  - Ticket
  - Fare
  - Cabin
  - Embarked
  - Survived (Target variable)

## 🧠 What I Did
- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values)
- Dropped unnecessary columns (like Name, Cabin, Ticket)
- Encoded categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Used `RandomForestClassifier` for prediction
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report & confusion matrix

## 🚀 Model Accuracy
The model gives decent accuracy in predicting survival using Random Forest.

## 🛠 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
